this is just for my development convenience.
for general purposes, i guess it's better for you to look at:
    https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt
    https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static

qemu source:
    https://github.com/yamt/qemu/tree/linux-user-for-docker

qemu build memo:

i built it with ../myubuntu image using --platform linux/arm64
on docker desktop for macos.

you can find my qemu config in myqemuconfig.sh in this directory.
